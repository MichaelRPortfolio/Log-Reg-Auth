# Log-Reg-Auth
Simple Login/Register with encrypted authorization by https://github.com/MichaelRPortfolio.

This triple script allows for Login and Register functionality with SHA-512 encryption/MongoDB database/Windows Forms.
This triple script was made for my personal use as a component to many future projects that need a user-friendly encrypted login.
